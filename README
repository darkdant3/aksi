Aká¹£i is a handwritten-digit-recognizing neural-network that I created for a semester project in my Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms class at ASU Poly. Our professor asked up to pick any topic we liked. I've always been interested in Neural Networks, but I never really got the time to learn about them. I decided to use this opportunity to realize my interest. Armed with tutorials, examples, and research papers I set about creating my network. It was challenging, but at the end I learnt a lot.
